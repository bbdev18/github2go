# Fetch vs Pull

You can use git fetch when you need to sync your local repository with the remote but still you don’t merge the changes into your working directory. It doesn’t transfer any files, but it lists what are the changes that happened in the remote.

git pull drag the file changes down and merge them with what you are currently working on.
